==============================================================================
*1* Introduction						*sf-intro*

Symfind can be used to scan and locate file or symbol in your project folder. 
It can work with vim.

Why do we use this tool? Let's compare to some similar tools:
	ctags
	vim + fuzzyfind
	cscope
	source navigator
	global

Key features of Symfind:
- natural search pattern for file or symbol (|sf-query|)
  e.g. Search a symbol that contains "res" and "linux". Most tools cannot do
  this partly search and require full symbol name or at least the part it
  begins with. Some tools can use regexp pattern like ".*res.*linux.*", but
  you have to try ".*linux.*res.*" if the order is different. And more, it's
  very slow. 
 
  Symfind directly use the natural pattern "res linux". And it performs in-memory
  search, so very fast.

- small database
  The size of my project folder is ~7G, and contains ~60000 source files. ctags 
  generates tag file that is >300M. 
  Source navigator produce >1G repository.
  Symfind scans the folder in 3 minutes, and the repo-file is about 17M.

- simple, stable and reliable
  In my project, I tried some tools, some cannot find some symbol, or cannot find xref.
  I use cscope in vim, but it often lose connection.
  Symfind uses grep directly on orignial files, slower but safe.

- value search for macro or variable
  Other tools have to use grep. 

- vim integration

Symfind is designed for easy locating symbols in large project. It is powerful 
for symbol lookup, and use simple strategy for reference lookup. It's simple,
stable, reliable and fast.

==============================================================================
*2* Install							*sf-install*

On MS Windows, you need install Perl.
Modify install_windows.bat for your path and just run it. It's easy and 
just copy files to your folder.

On Linux, modify path in script install_linux and run it. 

stags (for Linux) and stags.exe (for Windows) is included. It's used by
symscan.pl. stags is a branch of ctags with slight change that works better
with Symfind. You can find source code of stags in symfind source package.

==============================================================================
*3*  Quick Start 						*:Symfind*

Key tools: >
	symscan.pl (code scanner, generates repo-file)
	symfind (search engine, command-line interface)
	symsvr.pl (search engine server, TCP/IP interface, a wrapper of symfind)
	symfind.vim (the vim plugin)
	stags, gzip (the required program, must copy to the binary path)

First, scan your project using symscan.pl. >
	$ symscan.pl $SBO_BASE/Source -o b1

It will create repository b1.gz. If you don't use option "-o", the default
repository is named 1.repo.gz.

To update the repository: >
	$ symscan.pl b1.gz

After the repo is ready, you can run symfind or symsvr.pl.  >
	$ symfind b1.gz

It's the command-line interface: >
	> ?
	(show command help)
	> f string cpp
	(find file name that has "string" and "cpp", case-insensitive search)
	> s Sbo string
	(find symbol name that has "Sbo" - match case as there's upper letter,
	 and contains "string" - ignore case as there's no upper letter.)
	> go 2
	(go to the 2nd location in the result list, by default open file using vi)
	> n
	(go to the next location)
	> N
	(go to the previous location)
	> q
	(quit)
	
To work with vim, first run symsvr: >
	$ symsvr.pl b1.gz

Then open symfind window in vim/gvim: >
	:Symfind
OR >
	\sf

Now input command in the Symfind window, and go to the result by press <Enter>
or double-click.

As |<c-]>| and |gf| are default vim shortcut for locate a symbol (tag) and file,
now I add the <leader> char in front of them for search in symfind: >
	\<c-]>  - search symbol in symfind
	\gf     - search file in symfind

==============================================================================
*4*  Use Symfind							*sf-using*

*4.1* Symfind Repository file (repo-file) 				*sf-repo*

A repo-file (e.g. 1.repo.gz) is a text file compressed using gzip. It contains
one or more repository. Each repository is for one folder. e.g. >
	$ symscan.pl /home/data/dir1 /home/data/dir2
The generated repo-file actually contains 2 repos respectively for the 2
folders.

To update the repo-file actually re-scan the original 2 folders: >
	$ symscan.pl 1.repo.gz

To update and add new folder to the repository: >
	$ symscan.pl 1.repo.gz /home/data/dir3

Pattern for scanning file~
2 variables are available for you to customize the scanning.
IGNORE_PAT 
	(default value = '*.o;*.obj;*.d;.*')
	Don't record such files into repo.
TAGSCAN_PAT 
	(default value = '*.c;*.cpp;*.h;*.hpp;*.cc;*.mak;*.cs;*.java;*.s')
	Scan such files for symbols.

(TODO: set envvar to customize)

==============================================================================
*4.2* Query syntax						*sf-query*
Query by words seperated by space; Word that contains captain letter performs 
case-sensitive search, or else case-insensitive: >
	> s foo Bar
	(symbols contain "foo" (case-insensitive) and "Bar" (case-sensitive))

Start-with/end-with is suppported by "^" and "$" (like regexp): >
	> f ^Sbo .cpp$
	(files start with "Sbo" and end with ".cpp")
(Perl version *symfind.pl* uses perl-style Regexp. Thus, "." is a magic char in
 Regexp, you should use "\.cpp$" instead.)

Search in folder: xxx/ ~
For files, pattern that ends with "/" means search folder name: >
	> f ace thirdparty/
	(files that contain "ace" and in a folder that contains "thirdparty")

Search symbol kind~
For symbols, the result lists symbol names and kinds. To filter the result by
kind, use the first character of the kind name, e.g. "c" for "class": >
	> s string
	(list symbols match "string", there are kinds of "prototype", "class",
	 "function", "macro" and "member")
	> s string c
	(just find "class")
If it cannot filter kinds with the first-char, use the 2nd (or 3rd...): >
	> s string m
	(find "member" or "macro")
	> s string m e
	(find "member" - match 2 chars of kind)
	> s string m e m
	(find "member")

Search symbol value: #xxx ~
For symbols, pattern that starts with "#" means search in values. E.g. you get
a error code -5002 and want to see if some macro is defined by this value: >
	> s #-5002

You can composite all the features. e.g. >
	> s ^dbm #-5002 m
	(start with "dbm", value contains "-5002" and is a "macro")

2-choices: symfind and symfind.pl ~
They have almost the same functions. *symfind* is recommended as it's re-written 
using C++ with speed and memory optimization.
e.g. load 65322 files, 2022655 symbols (19M repo-file): symfind.pl uses 8.1s 
and 1.1G memory; symfind uses 0.6s and 180M memory.  For a full symbols search 
with 2 words (e.g. "hello world"), symfind.pl costs 2.8s, and symfind costs 0.4s.

Note: by default symsvr.pl uses symfind for the search engine. To use
symfind.pl, set envvar SYMFIND, e.g. (on Linux) >
	$ SYMFIND=symfind.pl symsvr.pl 1.repo.gz

==============================================================================
*4.3* Options 							*sf-options*

Change max result items~
By default 25 items are listed in the result. To change it: >
	> max 50

Change editor~
By default "vi" is used to open file, to change it: >
	> editor
	(view the current editor)

	> editor gvim
	(change editor)

Change root~
Root is the top-level folder name when you scan your project. e.g. >
	$ symscan.pl /mnt/data/depot/sbo
the root is "/mnt/data/depot/sbo". If you moved it to another path, e.g.
"/mnt/data/depot2/sbo", then you can set option to reuse the repo-file: >
	> dir /mnt/data/depot/sbo=/mnt/data/depot2/sbo

OR simply >
	> dir depot=depot2

The result folder name will be checked and replaced if neccessary.

==============================================================================
*5* Use Symsvr and vim plugin					*sf-symsvr*

*symsvr.pl* is a program that enables symfind to be a symbol server. By
default, it use TCP port 20000 - instance 0 (port=instance_no+20000). If you
want to use another instance/port: >
	$ symsvr.pl 1.repo.gz &
	  (TCP/20000)
	$ symsvr.pl 2.repo.gz :1 &
	  (TCP/20001)

The vim plugin~
After the server starts, you can start vim to search. Use :Symfind command to 
open the search window. >
	:Symfind
or use the default mapped shortcut: >
	\sf

If you use instance 1, the command is like this: >
	:Symfind :1
or >
	\1sf

Symsvr as a client~
For test, you can directly search in shell by "symsvr.pl -c": >
	$ symsvr.pl -c "f sbo string"
	  (find file)
	$ symsvr.pl -c "s hello world" :1
	  (find symbol using instance 1 - port 20001)

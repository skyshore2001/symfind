> NF201305.1 - root dir replace
v1.1

Requirement:
if the path of your source code changes, the old repo should still work, no need to re-scan.

Design:
Add "root" command to support dir replace. You can define multiple replace rules in one line.
e.g. 
	> root
	(show root definition)
	> root depot=depot2
	(define 1 rule: "depot" -> "depot2")
	> root depot=depot2;/mnt/data=/home
	(define 2 rules: "depot" -> "depot2", "/mnt/data" -> "/home")
	> root .
	(clear)

the final result
	/mnt/data/depot/sbo/source/1.cpp
will be replaced to 
	/home/depot2/sbo/source/1.cpp
